Crafting patient record features
Copy/paste this as your Lovable prompt (it’s already structured, unambiguous, and matches exactly what you described):

Build a responsive, attractive medical-themed web app called “Arogya AI”. Use React 18 + TypeScript with a clean modern UI (shadcn/ui + Tailwind). Do NOT add any extra pages or features beyond what is specified. Keep the theme “clinical / medical” (clean, lots of whitespace, professional), but avoid overly complex visuals.

0) Global Requirements
Use React Router.
Use a layout with consistent spacing and professional typography.
Use shadcn/ui components (Button, Card, Tabs, Input, Textarea, Dialog if needed, Table, Badge, Separator).
Include loading states and friendly inline error messages.
Implement auth state as a simple client-side mock for now (localStorage/sessionStorage):
userRole: "doctor" or "patient"
patientId: string for patients
Add Logout button in both dashboards that clears auth state and returns to Landing.
1) Pages / Routes
Create only these routes:

A) Landing Page /
Medical-themed landing page with:

Navigation header (logo/name “Arogya AI” + a “Get Started” button).
Hero section:
Headline: “Arogya AI: The Intelligent Clinical Safety Layer”
Subheadline: “Assisting the Doctor, Empowering the Patient, Humanizing Healthcare.”
Primary CTA button: “Get Started”
On click “Get Started”, navigate to /auth.
B) Auth Flow /auth
This is a combined Signup/Login experience (single page is fine) with role selection.

Requirements:

Show two large selectable cards/buttons:
“Patient Login”
“Doctor Login”
After role selection:
Show a simple form (email + password fields). Include both “Login” and “Sign Up” buttons (same UI, no backend).
On successful mock login/signup:
If Doctor: navigate to /doctor
If Patient: navigate to /patient
Patient ID generation:
When a patient logs in/signs up, generate a Patient ID (e.g., a short random ID like PAT-XXXXX) and store it in localStorage as patientId.
Show the Patient ID on patient dashboard (top-right corner).
2) Doctor Dashboard /doctor
Create a dashboard layout:

Top bar with app name + Logout button.
Left sidebar navigation with exactly these sections:
Patient Records
AI Prescription Verifier
Drug Interaction Check
MRI/X-ray Scan
Each section is a page/route under the doctor area (nested routes are fine):

/doctor/records
/doctor/prescription-verifier
/doctor/drug-interactions
/doctor/scans
Default route: /doctor/records.

2.1 Doctor Feature: Patient Records /doctor/records
UI requirements:

Input field: “Enter Patient ID”
Button: “Fetch Records”
Once fetched, show a table/list of records for that patient:
Record name/title (or filename)
Submitted date and time
Actions:
View (opens a preview panel or modal)
Download (downloads the file)
If multiple records exist, display all, sorted newest first.
For now, use mocked data in-app (until backend exists). Make it easy to replace with API later.
2.2 Doctor Feature: AI Prescription Verifier /doctor/prescription-verifier
Layout requirements:

Left side: Upload area + controls
Right side: AI summarized response box
Bottom: AI Chatbot panel (sticky at bottom of the content area)
UI components:

Upload control to upload patient record files (PDF/images) (mock handling is fine).
Button: “Submit & Analyze”
On click:
Show loading state
Then show an “AI Summary” in a right-side Card (mock summary text)
AI Chatbot at bottom:
Chat input + Send button
Message thread area
The doctor can ask questions “about the records” and receive mock answers
Keep the chatbot visible at the bottom of this page only (not global).
2.3 Doctor Feature: Drug Interaction Check /doctor/drug-interactions
This feature MUST be a 3-step flow (wizard). Use a Stepper UI or clearly labeled steps.

Step 1: Drug inputs

Two drug inputs, each with:
Drug name
Dosage (free text, e.g., “500mg twice daily”)
Button: “Next”
Step 2: Personal details

Age (number)
Height (number + unit label)
Weight (number + unit label)
Additional information (optional Textarea)
Button: “Next”
Step 3: Summarize

Button: “Summarize”
Show the response (mocked) in a result panel/card on the same page.
Allow Back navigation to previous steps (but keep it simple).
The response should look medical/structured (example format):

Overall status: Safe / Warning
Explanation paragraph
Suggested next steps (bullets)
2.4 Doctor Feature: MRI/X-ray Scan /doctor/scans
Layout requirements:

Left: Upload scan control + “Analyze” action
Right: Result panel showing analysis summary (mock)
Bottom: Chatbot panel for questions about the scan summary
UI components:

Upload button (accept images)
Button: “Analyze”
Result card on right side with:
“Assistive, non-diagnostic” label
Summary text (mock)
Chatbot at bottom (same style as prescription verifier chatbot)
3) Patient Dashboard /patient
Dashboard layout:

Top bar with app name + Patient ID shown at top-right + Logout button.
Left sidebar navigation with exactly:
Upload Records
My Documents
Default route: /patient/upload.

3.1 Patient Feature: Upload Records /patient/upload
UI requirements:

Upload control for patient records
After upload: show “Upload successful” message (inline alert or toast)
Store uploaded items in client-side state so they appear in “My Documents”.
3.2 Patient Feature: My Documents /patient/documents
UI requirements:

Table/list of uploaded documents
Each item has:
Filename
Uploaded date/time
Actions: View and Download
4) Data / Mocking Rules (until backend exists)
Use client-side mocked storage for records and documents:
When patient uploads documents, save them (metadata + object URL) in localStorage or in-memory state (localStorage preferred for persistence).
Doctor “Fetch Records” should retrieve by patient ID from this same store (simulate real behavior).
Keep types clean and centralized:
PatientRecord: { id, patientId, filename, uploadedAt, url }
ChatMessage: { role: "user" | "assistant", content, timestamp }
5) UX Notes (Important)
Keep everything minimal and professional.
Do not add extra features like analytics, settings pages, or admin panels.
Ensure navigation is clear and flows match exactly:
Landing → Get Started → Auth → Choose role → Login/Signup → correct dashboard.
Deliver the complete frontend project ready to run.

If you want, I can also create a matching backend API contract (endpoints + request/response JSON) so when you “bring the Lovable frontend files here,” we can connect it cleanly without changing UI behavior.

yep do that , after i bring frontnend folder

Updating documentation and committing
I’ll add an API_CONTRACT.md now (backend endpoints + request/response schemas) so when you drop in the Lovable frontend/ folder, we can wire it up immediately with minimal changes.

git status
git add .gitignore API_CONTRACT.md readme.md; git commit -m "Add API contract and gitignore"; git push
Added the backend/frontend schema doc at API_CONTRACT.md and linked it in readme.md. Also added .gitignore so your local-only agent guide won’t be committed.

Right now these changes are NOT committed yet (you skipped the commit). If you want them pushed to GitHub, run:

git add .gitignore [API_CONTRACT.md](http://_vscodecontentref_/3) readme.md
git commit -m "Add API contract and gitignore"
git push
When you bring the Lovable frontend/ folder

Drop it into the repo root as frontend/.
Tell me once it’s there, and I’ll:
align its API calls to API_CONTRACT.md,
scaffold the FastAPI backend with matching endpoints,
set up CORS + environment (VITE_API_BASE_URL),
wire “view/download” to the /files/... endpoints.
If you want the cleanest integration: make sure Lovable uses VITE_API_BASE_URL and keeps all API calls in one place (e.g., src/api/).
